1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A .gitignore file is a file that excludes certain types of files during committing and merging. This is done to prevent unnecessary files from being added in source control for large projects. For a java project, the file must include a .java type.

2. What does fast-forward in git mean?
Fast-forwarding means having your current local branch catch up with another existing branch.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Changes should not be made or pushed to the master branch unless they're minor. This should be reserved for the working version of the project. Without different branches, it will become difficult to keep track of the overall changes and end up cluttering the repository. In collaborative environments, teammates might overwrite each other's changes and either lose valuable data or create merge conflicts that have to be resolved.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
I personally use one remote repository per project.
